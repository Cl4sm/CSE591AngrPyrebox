# PyREBox sample script - Monitor process creation and break on entry point
# =========================================================================

# This script uses several PyREBox features that allow to monitor
# process creation in the guest system, extract the entry point for
# a target process and set an execution breakpoint on that address.

# This script should be enough to understand how to:
#   0) Initialize and clean callbacks using the predefined functions initialize_callbacks and clean
#   1) Create and remove callbacks using the CallbackManager interface
#   2) Integrate a PyREBox script with a python module, such as pefile
#   3) Start a shell from a PyREBox script
#   4) Set a breakpoint from a PyREBox script using the BP class
#   5) Using partial function application to pass additional parameters to a callback
#   6) Using the PyREBox printer function that will prepend the script name to every line you print
#   7) Defining custom commands that can be used from the ipython shell
